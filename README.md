# hello-world

Hello!

Welcome to my GitHub page! I currently am a hobbyist programmer learning all I can for a future career in the field. I mainly do Game Development with Unity and I wanted a place I could store some of the scripts I've written so I don't lose them! I am also learning python3 and know a bit about Javascript, HTML, CSS, C++, Visual Basic, and Java. I hope my adventures on GitHub serve me well.
